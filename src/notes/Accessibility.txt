01) The onblur event occurs when an object loses focus.
    The onblur event is most often used with form validation code (e.g. when the user leaves a form field).
    
    Tip: The onblur event is the opposite of the onfocus event.
    Tip: The onblur event is similar to the onfocusout event. The main difference is that the onblur event does not bubble.
        Therefore, if you want to find out whether an element or its child loses focus, you could use the onfocusout event.
        However, you can achieve this by using the optional useCapture parameter of the addEventListener() method for the onblur event.
